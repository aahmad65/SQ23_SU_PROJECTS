<h1>Spring Quarter Projects, 2023</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

These projects were completed through my third quarter at Seattle University. This quarter was rough at first but I turned it around. This was my Data Structures class where we would make our own classes of the already created structures and collections in C++. This was heaps, stacks, BSTs, linked lists, and hashing. I will admit that the P2 in this repository was not my best work. I failed that project, but I thought it was important to show the progress of my development in C++ and coding in general. It was a rough project but I turned the class around and made sure I understood everything by the time the final exam and final prokect came.

P1: Understanding Linked Lists and Dynamic Memory <br/>
P2: Stacks <br/>
P3: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) <br/>
P4: Heaps <br/> 
P5: Hashing <br/>
